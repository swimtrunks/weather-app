"WTHr app": Simple Weather App

<h3>Objective:</h3>

I wanted to work with the Geolocation API to create a local weather app for the user in the browser. I started with this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/7688363-01-Weather-App-Concept" alt="Weather App Concept by Damian Martelli">sketch</a> from dribbble as a template and added some different stylings to finish it. The app pulls the location from the browser as well as time and then retrieves the weather info from <a href="OpenWeatherMap.org" alt="Open Weather Map website">this API</a>. It provides a the current location, current temp alongside the high and low, and a brief description of the weather itself. I also added a background watercolor image that changes depending on the weather as well. If it is over a 89 degress it will change to a red watercolor stroke, if its raining it will change grey, etc.

<h3>What's Next:</h3>

I also planned on adding a search feature where the user can search for a location instead of solely pulling it from the browser. There is also a 5 day forcast that I want to add and actually the app already displays the temperatures accurately but I have yet to implement the changing of the weather icons based on those temperatures. 

<h3>Design:</h3>

This was really just meant to be a quick project so the styling isnt as responsive as it could be but mostly I worked in the mobile first design methodology. <br /> <br />
